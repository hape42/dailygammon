    <h1>We need your help!</h1>
    
    <p>You are missing a feature?</p>
    <p>You have found a bug?</p>
    <p>You have an idea how to implement something better than we have done so far?</p>
    <p>You have an idea that no one has come up with yet?</p>
    <p>Then join our team on GitHub and work together with us on the continuous development of the app. Or just send us an email</p>

    <p>You don't have to be good at IOS programming to help. We also need help describing problems. And we also need support in testing new versions.</p>

    <p>Did we make you curious?</p>
