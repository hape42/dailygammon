    <h1>Welcome to DailyGammon app</h1>
    <p>A way to play backgammon games and tournaments with real people from around the world, all at once. It is free and ad-free.</p>
    <p>Play is at your own pace with opponents who usually won’t be online at the same time as you. You can have dozens of games going all at once.</p>
    <p>This DailyGammon app is a client for the DailyGammon.com web service, started over 20 years ago. You can play directly from a web browser like Safari, but from iPhone or iPad, the web-play experience is challenging.</p>
    <p>This app helps by improving display, moves, and chat. And it can notify when you have games ready to play.</p>
    <h2>Getting started is a bit Complicated. Here’s the process:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Register and confirm DailyGammon login.</li>
        <li>Login through this app.</li>
        <li>Visit Game Lounge (menu button top-right).</li>
        <li>Find "Beginners Tournament" and Sign Up.</li>
        <li>Wait for tournament to start, after enough others have signed up (a few hours to days).</li>
        <li>Visit Top Page to see games where you can play, and tap opponent name to play.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The hardest part to starting is getting your DailyGammon account setup.</p>
    <p>Be sure to enter a correct email and remember your chosen username. You should get email with your initial password within 24 hours. If you don’t receive it, email <b>dghelp@gmail.com</b> and include your requested username.</p>
    <p>We hope that’s enough to get you started. There are more new-user hints at <a href="http://www.dailygammon.com/help/hints.html">http://www.dailygammon.com/help/hints.html</a>.</p>
    <p>Note that this app is NOT built by the creators of the DailyGammon service.</p>
