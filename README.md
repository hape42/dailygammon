### 🟢 What is Dailygammon?

DailyGammon is a mixture of letter chess and backgammon. You sign up for one or more games (most players have several games going at once) with other players on the [site](http://dailygammon.com/). When you sign up, you make a series of moves in each game (move order), and the server records your moves. Later, your opponent logs in and responds to your moves. Then when you log back in, those moves are waiting for you! Using this method, you can complete an entire backgammon match over the course of a few weeks, taking only a few minutes each day. There are so-called time credits per match which can grow with the number of moves already made. I myself always have a few dozen games running at the same time. It is a very big advantage to be able to take as much time as you want for a move. You should definitely try this out as a backgammon player. 



### 🟢 Why I have developed an app as a client for the Dailygammon server?
🟢 The site has the cleanest html code you can imagine. and this has been stable for many years. unfortunately, this also means that there is no energy for adjustments on modern devices and the resulting demands. On a PC in the browser it's all still ok. But on an iPad or iPhone it really needs improvement. 

I have full understanding for the operator of the website that he does not want to invest in further developments. everything has been running stable for many years and it should stay that way.

On an iPhone, everything is teeny tiny and you have to aim really accurately (or re-zoom on each move) to touch the checkers for a move.

I just wanted it to be more comfortable to play. So I jumped into the adventure and started to develop a native app for my iPad.

I just need to read and interpret the clean HTML code and somehow implement it in my app. 😂

That's how naive I really was, I had little idea of HTML and only a beginner's knowledge of Objective-C

But I found the code from Hpple (Created by [Geoffrey Grosenbach](http://topfunky.com)) relatively fast. This helped me a lot in parsing the HTML.


 ### History  
🟢 2018 I started this as a project optimized for my iPad just for myself. I'm a software developer, but my last jobs as a developer were a long time ago and were mainly in C. I had to learn Objective-C first.
 
So I had to learn Objective-C first. The project grew slowly like a project grows when you do it for yourself. In the beginning I was only trying to make it possible to play. Other features came little by little. 

Finally I dared to make the app available to all Dailygammon players via the Appstore. Important for me was to implement the spirit of Dailygammon in the app. Free of charge and no advertising. Only the pure game should present itself to the user.
 
It came as it had to come. The more players used the app, the more errors came up. Partly due to different devices, partly from using the app in a way I never did. As a developer, you test your own work in a very limited way.

So it came one bugFix after another, smaller improvements and new features.

Constantly struggling with the shortage of time. The project became bigger and bigger.

Communication was/is also very difficult. My English skills are more those of a beginner. Complicated discussions with users were very difficult for me. But thank god i found deepl.com. it helps me a lot.


### Help Wanted

🔵 Ich wollte natürlich niemand an mein Baby ran lassen. Das habe ich in vielen Nächten und Wochenenden erschaffen.

🔵 Aber ich habe meine Einstellung dazu geändert. ich würde sehr gerne das alles mit Entwicklern teilen.

* 🔵 Zum Einen gibt es womöglich Code Fragmente die anderen helfen könnten.
* 🔵 Zum anderen gibt es noch jede menge zu tun um die app fertig zu machen (kann eine app überhaupt fertig werden?)
 
🔵 ich werde also jeden als contributer willkommen heissen der ein paar der Anforderungen erfüllt.
* 🔵 Erfahrung als Software entwickler in Objective-c und oder Swift (das ist sehr wichtig, den ich suche Unterstützung aus zeitgründen und kann keine zeit aufwenden um jemand programmieren beizubringen)
* 🔵 Erfahrung in Git und github (ich selbst verfüge nur über oberflächenwissen von git bzw github und wir müssen ja über github zusammen arbieten können)
* 🔵 das Spiel Backgammon zu kennen wäre natürlich hilfreich, ist aber nicht unbedingt erforderlich. Allerdings benötigt man einen account auf dailygammon.com um sinnvoll testen zu können

🔵 Ich bin auch bereit die komplette app umzuschreiben, wenn es bessere lösungen für ein bestimmtes thema gibt.

🔵 mir ist durchaus bewusst, dass mich diese Hilfe (womöglich von mehreren personen) erst mal sehr viel zeit kosten wird. Ich werde viel erklären müssen warum ich das so und so programmiert habe. Ich werde ab sofort den Code durchforsten und versuchen inline schon mal einiges zu kommentieren. ich werde auch viel namen ändern die ich im code benutzt habe und nur für deutsch sprechende menschen zu verstehen sind 😇
Aber ich bin bereit diesen Weg zu gehen.
